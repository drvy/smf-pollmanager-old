# SMF Poll Manager 2010-2012

This is a series of single-file scripts aimed at viewing and managing SMF (Simple Machines Forums) polls since the CMS didn't provide that functionality.

The dating is not exact but they were all created around 2010 and 2012 as the screen captures suggest.

Please KEEP IN MIND these scrips **ARE VULNERABLE** to SQL Injections and other security issues since they were more intented for personal use. **This repository is available purely for historical reasons**.
